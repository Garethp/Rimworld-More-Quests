## More Relic Quests

Ever get tired of having the same three quests to find relics, over and over? This mod aims to fix that, slightly, by
adding more variety to your quests. So far you can:

 * Pay a donation to the village with a terminal instead of shooting them

### Roadmap

This mod is starting off small, but I do have plans to add more quests as time goes on. So far my ideas include:

 * Protect a village from a raid or three of mechanoids
 * Save a village child who has been enslaved by some pirates
 * Go hunt a pack of maddened Thrumbo's threatening a village
 * Become allies with another Faction on the planet
 * Perform a good religious ceremony (or better) with some of their villagers in attendance
